<h2>Team profile</h2>
<h5>Name: Zijie Luo</h5> <br>
<a><img src="Test1.jpg" alt="bamboo" width="500" height="400"></a>
<a><img src="Test2.jpg" alt="bamboo" width="400" height="150"></a><br>
The first test proved that I am a protector who likes to take charge of things and be enthusiastic.
The second test proved that I am a visual learner. I usually understand and learn things through vision, and I can easily attract attention with rich image colors and sounds.<br>
The third is an intelligence test. The result of the test is that my IQ is between 105 and 120, which is equivalent to the normal college level.<br>
Summarizing the results of these three tests, I am a person who can be seriously responsible in the team, will complete their tasks on time and can help others, but in the team work may be affected by other things, when forming the team I need a strong leader to supervise me, and I can be the one who helps the leader manage the team.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h5>Name: Kaylee</h5><br>
    1. Myers-Briggs test: Mind: Introvert 53%, Energy: Observant 54%, Nature: Feeling 65%, Tactics: Prospecting 58%, Identity: Turbulent: 64%<br>
    2. Learning Style test: Auditory: 25%, Visual: 40%, Tactile: 35% <br>
    3. Big Five Personality test: Extraversion 42%, Agreeableness 67%, Conscientiousness 84%, Neuroticism 40%, Openness 60%.<br>
These tests tell me what is my personality, and what is my learning type is. I am likely to be an introvert. This may affect my teamwork ability. However, this is a challenge for me to get over myself. With my conscientiousness, I will try my best to do all my work as a team.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
 <h5> Name: Jason</h5><br>
  The results of an online Myers-Briggs test:<br>
  <a><img src="Test3.png" alt="T3"></a><br>
  The results of an online learning style test:<br>
   <a><img src="Test4.png" alt="T4"></a><br>
   The results of one further online test:<br>
O = Openness, C = Conscientiousness, E = Extraversion, A = greeableness, N = Neuroticism<br>
  <a><img src="Test5.png" alt="T5"></a><br>
I think some opinions in the results of these tests are true for me, but not all. Maybe as the results show I’m auditory learner, so I will pay attention to this and more use this way to study in the future. The result also show I'm introverted and I admit it, this is one of the drawbacks for me, but l will try to get over it. There are all results mean for me: keep going and develop myself.<br>
Different people have different personalities, these personality must influence the behavior when they are working as a team; For example, I’m introverted, this will influence the team communication in a team; if you are a sense of responsibility and easy-going, people will like to work with you.<br>
If I’m the team manager, I will assign different tasks to people who have different personalities. If people who are outgoing, these people usually have communication and language skills, so they are Suitable to be a diplomat; If people who are introverted, these kind of people always have a sense of responsibility and work very hard in the team. So they are suitable to be a staff such as programmer. That is my opinion.<br>
<br>
<br>
 <h5> Name: Eric</h5><br>
 <a><img src="Test6.png" alt="T6"></a><br>
 <a><img src="Test7.png" alt="T7"></a><br>
 <a><img src="Test8.png" alt="T8"></a><br>
 Although these data can not represent my real person, it is indeed a reference indicator for me. In my opinion, this data allows me to understand myself more specifically. As the learning test shows, I am a visual learner. I fully agree with this point. There is no way for my subconscious to grasp the abstract things. But if it is a very specific thing, then I will remember or learn very quickly. For example, I chose IT instead of business haha! Those abstract theories are more difficult to understand and learn than actual code.<br>
The structure of a team is simply the leader and the team members. After the leader receives the task and discuss with the group member and then assigns the task, the leader needs experience and determination. He needs to make the right choices right away from his experience, and he can't hesitate to let the team members question the task and slow down the work. The team members need to do the assigned work well and meet the mission requirements. They cannot slow down the whole project because they are slow. This requires patience and seriousness. So I may be more suitable for team members at the moment, and carefully assign the assigned tasks.
So when teaming up, I might need to find an experienced and determined leader and do the assignment. Let me play my abilities better.<br>
<br>
<br>
 <h5> Name: Haizhou Cheng</h5><br>
 The results of Myers-Briggs test:<br>
  <a><img src="Test9.png" alt="T9"></a><br>
  The results of learning style test:<br>
 <a><img src="Test10.png" alt="T10"></a><br>
 The result of persona test:<br>
 <a><img src="Test11.png" alt="T11"></a><br>
This result is trying to tell me that what I am, so I need to think about it and change the bad behaviour that may make me have bad relations with team members. It is a good thing that help me look at myself and help me become a better person. If I am going to make a team, I need to think about member behaviours cannot be too different, otherwise this team may not be able to do the work fluently.

And also this job can help me learning Artificial Intelligence in the future. And this job requires a lot of skills and experience, such as strong Python and JavaScript skills, have experience with AI or machine learning and LAMP + Mongo DB blended stack. Also need some experience about AWS knowledge, and they prefer the person who graduated recently.<br>
Zijie and Kaylee wants to be an IT supporter, this job requires both soft and hardware knowledge. For example, Installing and configuring computer hardware, software, servers, networks and printers. Maintain and configure a Microsoft Intune MDM solution.
Patch and support endpoints/servers. Monitor and report on existing systems. Maintain and configure an office365 environment including creating accounts, groups and mailboxes. Deliver effective and efficient customer service. Support the IT Coordinator as requires. To get this role, they must have at least 1 year experience in a similar role as well as demonstrated experience maintaining and configuring Windows endpoints, Office365 and Microsoft domains.

<h1>IT Technologies</h1>
<h2>Autonomous Vehicles</h2>

Autonomous vehicles, also known as driverless cars, computer-driven cars or wheeled mobile robots, are unmanned ground vehicles for transporting power. As an automated vehicle, autonomous vehicles can sense their environment and navigation without human intervention. Complete autonomous vehicles are still not fully commercialized, most of them are prototypes and display systems, and some reliable technologies are decentralized to mass production models, which has gradually become a reality.<br>
Autonomous vehicles can sense their environment with radar, optical radar, GPS and computer vision technologies. Advanced control systems convert sensory data into appropriate navigational roads, as well as obstacles and related signs. By definition, autonomous vehicles can update their map information by sensing the input data so that the vehicle can keep track of its location.<br>
The display system for self-driving cars dates back to the 1920s and 1930s, and the first truly autonomous car appeared in the 1980s. In 1984, Carnegie Mellon University promoted the Navlab program and the ALV program; in 1987, Mercedes-Benz and the Federal Defense University of Munich jointly promoted the Eureka Prometheus project. Since then, many large companies and research institutes have begun to produce prototypes of operational self-driving cars. After the 21st century, along with the advancement of information technology, it has been advancing by leaps and bounds. Fully-automobile vehicles have been manufactured on test vehicles. Tesla Motors is the first to introduce self-driving vehicles in specific environments.<br>
<h3>Development</h3>
Tucson Future Technology expects the official deployment of the fleet to begin in the second half of 2019. In addition to testing in California and Arizona, Tucson Future Technology, which was invested by NVIDIA, is also testing in Caofeidian Port and Tangcao Expressway in China, with a top speed of 90 km/h. As of March 2018, it has already tested 10,000 km. <br>
The Volvo Group expects to introduce a car that will prevent passengers from being injured in 2020. The Regal Group also claims that the vehicle will be able to effectively "away from the collision."<br>
GM, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, Regal, Nissan, BMW, Renault, Tesla and Google are all expected to launch cars that will be at least partially auto-driving by 2020.<br>
The goal of the Google Autopilot program is to solve all unresolved problems with today's autonomous vehicles by 2020.
Jaguar expects to launch autonomous vehicles in 2024.<br>
Daimler and Ford are expected to launch autonomous vehicles on the market in 2025. Ford is expected to launch its first self-driving car targeting the public but has not announced its target date.<br>
GM expects that most of the new cars it manufactures will have autopilot capabilities and shop floor communication technology by 2025.
IHS's car report predicts that by 2035, most autonomous vehicles will be able to operate completely independent of the control of human passengers.<br>
Navigant Research predicts that autonomous vehicles will gradually gain attention over the next 20 years, and by 2035, it will reach 95.4 million units per year, accounting for 75% of the overall automotive market.<br>
IEEE experts and scholars predict that up to 75% of vehicles will be automated by 2040.<br>
Some people hold the opposite view. Raj Rajkumar, director of Carnegie Mellon University's research on autonomous driving technology, said in 2014 that artificial intelligence for autonomous vehicles will not appear "very soon"; Detroit's cars Manufacturers believe that "the vision that a fully self-driving car can achieve in the short term is just a 'simple family fantasy.'"<br>
<h3>Potential advantage</h3>
Possible benefits of using autonomous vehicles include:<br>
Less traffic accidents, because autonomous vehicles do not have limited environmental sensing capabilities like human driving, but can use active and passive sensors (such as optical radar and radar) to continuously perform a wide range of sensing (such as visible light, infrared With sound waves such as ultrasonic waves, etc., with a 360-degree field of view, it can respond safely to potential crises, and its response can be more rapid than human driving.<br>
Avoid traffic accidents caused by human factors such as too close driving distance, distracted driving and dangerous driving.
Reduce the required safety gaps and better manage traffic flow, thereby increasing road capacity and reducing traffic congestion.
Reduce the work of vehicle passengers driving and navigation.<br>
Self-driving cars can have higher speed limits.
Exemption from passenger restrictions - In autonomous vehicles, there is no need to care if passengers are under-aged, old, driverless, blind, incompetent, drunk and so on.<br>
Relieve the shortage of urban parking spaces, because cars can allow passengers to get off the crowded area, stop at a densely populated area, stop at another location with enough parking space, and return to carry passengers when needed.
Increase car sharing and reduce the total number of vehicles, because autonomous vehicles can take passengers out of the car and carry another passenger to another place.
Reduce the physical space required for parking, so that the vehicle can only enter the parking space after driving, such as mechanical parking spaces.
Exempting Excess Passengers - Self-driving cars can be driven to the desired location, such as carrying passengers or performing maintenance, without the need for someone to be in the car. This is especially relevant for trucks, taxis and car sharing services.
Reduce the need for traffic police and car insurance costs.
Reducing physical road signs - Autonomous vehicles can receive the necessary communications electronically (although for human driving, physical signs are still required).
Smoother driving.
Because the vehicle's sensing ability is improved, theft of the vehicle can be reduced.
Removing the steering wheel and other driving interfaces saves cabin space and allows for cockpit design that does not require passengers to sit in the driver's seat.
Potential obstacle
Despite the many benefits of vehicle automation, the foreseeable challenges remain:
Liability for damages.
Individuals will resist giving up their control over the car.
Software reliability.
An inter-vehicle communication system is needed to coordinate the computer systems of individual cars, the information security of the car network, and the like.
The government must establish and implement a specific regulatory framework for autonomous vehicles.
Some drivers may not have experience if there is a need for manual driving.
Reduce job opportunities related to driving.
Loss of privacy.
For the communication between cars, more radio spectrum is needed.
Autonomous vehicles may be loaded with explosives, poisons, etc. for use as terrorist attacks.
An ethical issue like the tram problem - when the software of an autonomous car is forced to make a decision on possible damage in the event of an inevitable collision, problems can arise.
Reliability of the navigation system of the car under different weather types
Self-driving cars are functioning properly and require a very high-quality dedicated map. If these maps are out of date, autonomous vehicles must be able to return to reasonable behavior on their own.
At present, the gestures and physical functions of the police and other pedestrians cannot be recognized and understood by self-driving cars.
Current road infrastructure may need to be rebuilt for autonomous vehicles to achieve the best results. Some examples include traffic signs and streetlights that communicate with self-driving cars.
<h3>Possible influence</h3>
The Columbia University Earth Institute predicts that the total number of vehicles in the United States will be reduced to one-tenth.
PricewaterhouseCoopers predicts that the overall traffic accident will be reduced to one-tenth, and that the total number of vehicles in the United States will decline from 245 million to only 2.4 million.
KPMG and the Automotive Research Center predict that productivity and energy efficiency will improve, and new business models emerge.
Morgan Stanley predicts that autonomous vehicles can save $1.3 trillion a year in the United States, with fuel consumption accounting for $169 billion, cost of car accidents of $488 billion, and an increase in productivity of $645 billion.
<h3>Impact to people</h3>
If cars can self-driving, then I can use more vehicles in my daily life, and I don't have to worry about taking a driver's license. It is easier to plan a hike during the holidays. Taxi cars are also cheaper (because there is no labor cost). There is no longer a need to concentrate on driving and not being able to check the message or answer the call in time to delay some urgent matters. The urban environment we are in is better than the original. The self-driving cars can be driven in order. I don't have to worry if there will be drunk drivers or tired drivers who will hurt pedestrians because of his mistakes. Don't worry about family and friends. Going home too late because of traffic jams.

<h2>Machine Learning</h2>
<h3>What does it do? </h3>
Machine Learning is a is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models.  Arthur Samuels is the first person to describe his work “Machine Learning” at 1950s. Until the last few decades, people find computers have enough storage and processing power to analyze large amounts of data, after that machine learning become popular. Nowadays, machine learning has already become one of the most important subjects in the IT world. It is the core knowledge about artificial intelligence, without machine learning AI cannot work anyway.<br>
Machine learning is a way to help computer ‘learn’ something they cannot understand. For example what is animal, what is plant. What is the difference between a dog and a bird. What is the sun and moon. This very easy common sense are very hard to let computers understand. We cannot just tell them what is a dog, computer only can know a word make by letter D, O and G, but cannot tell you it is a dog when they see a dog. Because of that, researchers use a special way to ‘teach’ machine. They give a special program a lot of data about bird and dog by telling them birds and dogs characteristics and appearance. For example, dogs have 4 legs but birds only have 2, dogs have hair at all of their body but birds have feathers, dogs walking on land but bird flying in the sky. All of this different appearance can ‘teach’ computer and help it tell the correct answer when researcher show a dog image and a bird image in front of it. It sounds very easy, but if you suddenly show a dog image and a cat image in front of the computer, it has a high percentage shows the wrong answer. Because cats and dogs have very similar appearance for computer. So researchers need to keep giving computer plenty different types of data to make sure it will not make any mistakes in one area.<br>
Nowadays, machine learning have improving faster and faster. We can see AI in many different areas. Simply put, AI is a smart program which can help you predict the future by using big amount of data. For example, what is tomorrow’s weather, how is the economic future, when do you need to go out to catch the bus, what is the best way to go to school, what is your favourite cola brand and where can you buy it’s cola. Because of this powerful skill, AI will occupy a large number of jobs, all boss will like the employer who can do everything you order perfect and will not feel tired, work 7 days per week, don’t need any holiday and take very low salary. Not only change the work market, but also change our daily life. In recent 3 years, some city people will not need to drive by themselves, Autonomous vehicles will become mainstream. People don’t need to go to the supermarket by themselves, your fridge will take care of it. Card bag will be history, nfc is better. Still worried about junk email and Harassing phone call? Don’t worry, your phone will take care of it. All the things I mentioned above needs a powerful AI and machine learning is a part of AI.<br>
