<h5>Name: Zijie Luo</h5> <br>

<a><img src="Test2.jpg" alt="bamboo" width="400" height="150"></a><br>
The first test proved that I am a protector who likes to take charge of things and be enthusiastic.
The second test proved that I am a visual learner. I usually understand and learn things through vision, and I can easily attract attention with rich image colors and sounds.<br>
The third is an intelligence test. The result of the test is that my IQ is between 105 and 120, which is equivalent to the normal college level.<br>
Summarizing the results of these three tests, I am a person who can be seriously responsible in the team, will complete their tasks on time and can help others, but in the team work may be affected by other things, when forming the team I need a strong leader to supervise me, and I can be the one who helps the leader manage the team.<br>

  <h5>Name: Kaylee</h5><br>
    1. Myers-Briggs test: Mind: Introvert 53%, Energy: Observant 54%, Nature: Feeling 65%, Tactics: Prospecting 58%, Identity: Turbulent: 64%<br>
    2. Learning Style test: Auditory: 25%, Visual: 40%, Tactile: 35% <br>
    3. Big Five Personality test: Extraversion 42%, Agreeableness 67%, Conscientiousness 84%, Neuroticism 40%, Openness 60%.<br>
These tests tell me what is my personality, and what is my learning type is. I am likely to be an introvert. This may affect my teamwork ability. However, this is a challenge for me to get over myself. With my conscientiousness, I will try my best to do all my work as a team.<br>

I think some opinions in the results of these tests are true for me, but not all. Maybe as the results show I’m auditory learner, so I will pay attention to this and more use this way to study in the future. The result also show I'm introverted and I admit it, this is one of the drawbacks for me, but l will try to get over it. There are all results mean for me: keep going and develop myself.<br>
Different people have different personalities, these personality must influence the behavior when they are working as a team; For example, I’m introverted, this will influence the team communication in a team; if you are a sense of responsibility and easy-going, people will like to work with you.<br>
If I’m the team manager, I will assign different tasks to people who have different personalities. If people who are outgoing, these people usually have communication and language skills, so they are Suitable to be a diplomat; If people who are introverted, these kind of people always have a sense of responsibility and work very hard in the team. So they are suitable to be a staff such as programmer. That is my opinion.<br>

 Although these data can not represent my real person, it is indeed a reference indicator for me. In my opinion, this data allows me to understand myself more specifically. As the learning test shows, I am a visual learner. I fully agree with this point. There is no way for my subconscious to grasp the abstract things. But if it is a very specific thing, then I will remember or learn very quickly. For example, I chose IT instead of business haha! Those abstract theories are more difficult to understand and learn than actual code.
The structure of a team is simply the leader and the team members. After the leader receives the task and discuss with the group member and then assigns the task, the leader needs experience and determination. He needs to make the right choices right away from his experience, and he can't hesitate to let the team members question the task and slow down the work. The team members need to do the assigned work well and meet the mission requirements. They cannot slow down the whole project because they are slow. This requires patience and seriousness. So I may be more suitable for team members at the moment, and carefully assign the assigned tasks.
So when teaming up, I might need to find an experienced and determined leader and do the assignment. Let me play my abilities better.
